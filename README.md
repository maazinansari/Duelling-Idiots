# Duelling-Idiots

Paul J. Nahin provided MATLAB code to the problems in his book
*Duelling Idiots and Other Probability Puzzlers* 
([Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/712526.Duelling_Idiots_and_Other_Probability_Puzzlers) | 
[Amazon](http://a.co/gBvAOpo)). 
They are mostly simulations to verify the analytical solution.

Before looking at Nahin's solutions, I've tried to solve the problems on my own first. 
Each problem is its own script. So, problems with multiple parts will have all parts in the same script.

I've done my best to rewrite Nahin's original MATLAB code in R.
Those are saved in nahin-R. I made some adjustments that take advantage of
vectors and control flow in R, but for the most part the algorithms Nahin used
are still the same.
