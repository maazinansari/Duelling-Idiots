# Duelling-Idiots

Paul J. Nahin provided MATLAB code to the problems in his book
*Duelling Idiots and Other Probability Puzzlers*. They are mostly simulations
to verify the analytical solution.

Before looking at Nahin's solutions, I've tried to solve the problems on my own first.

I've done my best to rewrite Nahin's original MATLAB code in R.
Those are saved in nahin-R. I made some adjustments that take advantage of
vectors and control flow in R, but for the most part the algorithms Nahin used
are still the same.
